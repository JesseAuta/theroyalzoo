            <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
            <p>Dear Zoo Visitors,

                make your visit to the zoo a special experience for young and old.
                Our varied and exciting offer offers you new insights into the world of animals, animal husbandry and
                the importance of zoos for nature conservation. In doing so, we pay attention to an age-appropriate and
                understandable communication of the topics.
                Here you will find all offers from guided tours and children's birthday parties to zoo rallies and
                quizzes to information on education for sustainable development.
                We look forward to seeing you!

            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The Royal Zoo is home to around 1,031 animals representing 205 species. In addition to visitor favourites
                like the giraffes, African elephants, lions, Humboldt penguins and koalas, the zoo focuses on keeping
                and breeding endangered animals and rarely displayed Asian animals. The Royal Zoo boasts an extensive
                collection of native and European small birds, the likes of which are rarely found in other zoos. Some
                of the birds have also been very successfully bred. In our location, visitors can find rarely displayed
                tree dwellers. These include brown woolly monkeys, southern tamanduas, Prevost’s squirrels and crowned
                lemurs, which are now only found in one other zoo in Germany, namely Erfurt Zoo.</p>

            <H2>Zebra</H2>
            <img src="zebra.jfif" alt="zebra">
            <p>Zebras ( Hippotigris ) are a subgenus of the horse genus ( Equus ), which consists of three species:
                Grevy's zebra ( Equus grevyi ), mountain zebra ( Equus zebra ) and plains zebra ( Equus quagga ). The
                animals are particularly characterized by their black and white stripe pattern. All representatives of
                the zebra are found exclusively in Africa , where they mostly inhabit open landscapes. The populations
                of the individual species are threatened to varying degrees.</p>

            <h2>Red Panda</h2>
            <img src="red panda.png" alt="red panda">
            <p>The red pandas ( Ailurus ), also called red pandas or cat bears , are a genus of mammals that are native
                to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China and feed mainly on bamboo . Originally, only one
                species, Ailurus fulgens, was assigned to the genus Ailurus . However, molecular genetic studies from
                2020 show that the subspecies Styan's red panda, which was previously classified as such, should be
                granted species status (now Ailurus styani ) and the genus thus comprises two species. Contrary to
                previous assumptions in this direction, the genus is not closely related to the giant panda .</p>

            <h2>Bald Head Eagle</h2>
            <img src="american bald head eagle.png" alt="american bald head">
            <p>The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has
                two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), which
                occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and
                Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open
                water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.</p>

            <h2>Tiger</h2>
            <img src="tiger.png" alt="Tiger">
            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a
                powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly
                vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only
                two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</p>

            <h2>lion</h2>
            <img src="lion.png" alt="lion">
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of
                its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
                It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
                related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized
                and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>

            <h2>Parrot</h2>
            <img src="parrot.png" alt="Parrot">
            <p>Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines are birds with a strong curved
                beak, upright stance, and clawed feet.[a] They are classified in four families that contain roughly 410
                species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families are the
                Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuoidea (cockatoos),
                and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots).</p>
